# A-simple-k-means-for-protein
This is a simple project to represent k-means algorithm, to analysis amino acid sequence.
The original code was from https://www.cnblogs.com/zjutzz/p/5924762.html. Thanks for his code.
I did a little rectify on the cluster center and figure statement.
Also the dataset has been changed, differ from the original one.
